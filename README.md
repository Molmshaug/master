*This repository contains codes and analyses from my master thesis*

In the folder R contains codes and analyses for all tables and associated variables

Table 1: Contains baseline descriptive table

Table 2: Contain haematological variables from pre- and post-training and percentage change as well as t-test analyses for haematological from pre- to post-training

Table 3: Contain measurements obtrained during maximal endurance exercise tests at pre-, post-training and post-phlebotomy. As well as percentage change from pre-post and post-phle. This script also contains mixed-effects linear regression models (lmer) + post-hoc tests

Figure 4: Contain figures of haematological variables at pre- to post-training displaying individual and mean changes.

Figure 5: For participants who did the phlebotomy procedure. Contain a figure of VO2max, Wmax and PO 15min, displaying individual and mean changes

Figure 6: For participants who did not do the phlebotomy. Contain a figure of VO2max, Wmax and PO 15min, displaying individual and mean changes

Figure 7: Contain group difference analyses (ANCOVA) and figure of group difference in change scores from post-training to post-phlebotomy for Vo2max and PO 15min.

Figure 8: Contain linear regression model of change scores on endurance tests with amount of Hbmass (g) removed

Figure 9: Contain linear regression model of change scores on endurance tests with amount of blood (mL) removed
